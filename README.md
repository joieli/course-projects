Various programs created as a result of course projects.

### BME121_Isolation.cs
* First year intro to coding project
* A C# implementation of the "Isolation" board game that runs in the command-line.
* 2-Player turn based game. On your turn you move one space in any direction, then remove any unoccupied tile. The goal is to isolate the oponent so they cannot move.

### BME261_BlindCane.ino
* Second year biomedical design project
* Arduino code for a blindman's cane equipped with 3 ultrasonic sensors, 3 buzzers and a button. 
* Each ultrasonic sensor at a different vertical height corresponds to a different buzzer. 
* Buzzers buzz at different intensities based on distance. 
* Debounced button toggles cane on and off.

### BME252_CochlearImplantFilterBank.mlx
* Second year linear signals and systems project
* Filter bank implemented in MATLAB to reduce analog sound signals into 12 frequency bands for a cochlear implant.

### ELEC0024_FFT.py
* Third year digitial signal processing course
* Implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform using Python
